0.2
- Initial release

0.3
- Centered text on points
- prevented default scroll on mousewheel
- changed zooming defaults
- centrex,centrey no longer shared between instances on same page
- updated included version of jquery.mousewheel

0.4 
- Rebuilt colour facilities to use custom background and foreground

- Slightly more efficient, draw() only runs if there has been mouse 
movement Tidied up a few other minor bits and added a fix by
